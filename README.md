Each folder represents an algorithmical problem solvable with one or more of the following methods:
- Greedy
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound

In order to view the requirements, go to http://infoarena.ro/problema/FOLDER_NAME/. Some of them aren't taken from infoarena so you may not find them there. This repository is intended to become a collection of solutions to hard algorithmical problems featured in interviews and programming contests.
